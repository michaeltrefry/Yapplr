# Staging Environment Test Data Seeding

This document explains the automatic test data seeding that occurs in the staging environment.

## Overview

When the Yapplr API starts in the **Staging** environment, it automatically creates test data to provide a realistic dataset for testing and demonstration purposes. This eliminates the need to manually create users and content for every staging deployment.

## What Gets Created

### 1. Admin User
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Email**: `admin@yapplr.com`
- **Password**: `P@$$w0rd!`
- **Role**: Admin
- **Status**: Pre-verified email (no verification required)

### 2. Test Users (20 users)
All test users have:
- **Password**: `P@$$w0rd!`
- **Status**: Pre-verified email (no verification required)
- **Realistic profiles**: Names, bios, pronouns, taglines
- **Varied creation dates**: Spread over the last 30 days

#### Test User List
| Username | Email | Name | Pronouns |
|----------|-------|------|----------|
| alice_j | alice_j@example.com | Alice Johnson | she/her |
| bob_smith | bob_smith@example.com | Bob Smith | he/him |

| sam_j | sam_j@example.com | Sam Jackson | they/them |
| tara_w | tara_w@example.com | Tara Williams | she/her |

### 3. Sample Content
- **30 Posts Total**: Mix of regular and moderation test content
  - **15 Regular Posts**: Safe, realistic content for normal testing
  - **15 Moderation Test Posts**: Content designed to trigger AI moderation
- **30 Follow Relationships**: Random follow connections between users
- **40 Likes**: Distributed across posts from different users
- **20 Comments**: Engaging comments on various posts

#### Moderation Test Content Categories
The seeding includes posts that test various moderation scenarios:
- **NSFW Content**: Adult and sexual content detection
- **Violence**: Aggressive language and violent content
- **Harassment**: Personal attacks and bullying behavior
- **Hate Speech**: Discriminatory and xenophobic content
- **Misinformation**: Conspiracy theories and false health claims
- **Sensitive Content**: Mental health discussions and spoilers
- **Spam**: Promotional and attention-seeking content

## Technical Implementation

### Service: `StagingSeedService`
- **Location**: `Yapplr.Api/Services/StagingSeedService.cs`
- **Registration**: Only registered in Staging environment
- **Execution**: Runs automatically after database migrations and system tag seeding

### Environment Detection
```csharp
if (builder.Environment.IsEnvironment("Staging"))
{
    builder.Services.AddScoped<StagingSeedService>();
}
```

### Seeding Process
1. **Fresh Database**: Each deployment starts with an empty database
2. **Run Migrations**: Database schema is created from scratch
3. **Seed System Tags**: Default system tags are created
4. **Create Admin User**: Single admin with full permissions
5. **Create Test Users**: 20 users with realistic profiles
6. **Generate Content**: Posts, follows, likes, and comments
7. **Save Changes**: Commits all data to database

### Password Hashing
All passwords are properly hashed using BCrypt before storage:
```csharp
PasswordHash = BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.HashPassword("P@$$w0rd!")
```

### Email Verification Bypass
All users are created with `EmailVerified = true` to skip the email verification process in staging.

## Usage

### Automatic Seeding
Seeding happens automatically when:
1. The application starts in Staging environment
2. Database migrations complete successfully
3. Fresh database is created (no data persistence in staging)

**Note**: The staging environment uses an ephemeral database with no data persistence between deployments. This ensures every deployment starts with fresh seed data.

### Manual Testing
After deployment, you can immediately:
1. **Login as Admin**: Use `admin@yapplr.com` / `P@$$w0rd!`
2. **Test User Features**: Login as any test user with `P@$$w0rd!`
3. **Explore Content**: View posts, likes, comments, and follows
4. **Test Moderation**: Use admin account to moderate content

### AI Moderation Testing
The seeded content includes specific posts designed to test the AI moderation system:

#### **Admin Dashboard Testing**
1. **Login as Admin**: `admin@yapplr.com` / `P@$$w0rd!`
2. **Navigate to Content Queue**: Check for flagged posts
3. **Review AI Suggestions**: See AI-generated tag recommendations
4. **Test Approval Workflow**: Approve or reject AI suggestions
5. **Monitor System Performance**: Check moderation effectiveness

#### **Expected Moderation Results**
The test posts should trigger various AI responses:
- **High Risk Posts**: NSFW, violence, hate speech content
- **Medium Risk Posts**: Harassment, misinformation content
- **Low Risk Posts**: Sensitive topics, spoilers
- **Tag Suggestions**: ContentWarning and Violation tags
- **Risk Scores**: Range from MINIMAL to HIGH

#### **Testing Scenarios**
- **Auto-flagging**: Posts should appear in moderation queue
- **Tag Application**: AI should suggest appropriate system tags
- **Risk Assessment**: Different risk levels for different content types
- **Admin Override**: Test manual approval/rejection of AI decisions

### Deployment Integration
The seeding is integrated into the staging deployment process:
- **Docker Compose**: `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Staging` triggers seeding
- **Deploy Script**: `./deploy-stage.sh` automatically includes seeding
- **Health Checks**: Seeding completes before application becomes ready

## Environment Isolation

### Staging Only
- Seeding **ONLY** runs in Staging environment
- Production and Development environments are unaffected
- No risk of test data appearing in production

### Fresh Deployments
- Each staging deployment starts with a completely fresh database
- No data persistence between deployments
- Automatic seed data creation on every deployment
- Perfect for clean testing scenarios

## Security Considerations

### Test Passwords
- All test accounts use the same password: `P@$$w0rd!`
- **Never use these credentials in production**
- Passwords are properly hashed even in staging

### Email Domains
- Test users use `@example.com` domain
- Admin uses `@yapplr.com` domain
- No real email addresses are used

### Data Cleanup
- Staging data should be considered temporary
- Regular staging environment resets are recommended
- No sensitive or real user data is included

## Troubleshooting

### Seeding Not Running
1. Check environment is set to "Staging"
2. Verify `StagingSeedService` is registered
3. Check application startup logs for seeding messages

### Duplicate Data Errors
- Seeding skips if users already exist
- Clear database to force fresh seeding
- Check for unique constraint violations

### Login Issues
- Verify email verification is bypassed (`EmailVerified = true`)
- Confirm password hashing is working correctly
- Check user role assignments

## Logs

Look for these log messages during startup:
```
üå± Starting staging data seeding...
üëë Creating admin user...
üë• Creating 20 test users...
üìù Creating sample posts and interactions...
‚úÖ Staging data seeding completed successfully!
```
