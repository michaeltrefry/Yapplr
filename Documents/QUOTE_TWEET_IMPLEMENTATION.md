# Quote Tweet Feature Implementation

## Overview

The Quote Tweet feature allows users to share and comment on existing posts by creating a new post that includes the original post as a quoted reference. This feature enhances user engagement and content sharing capabilities.

## Architecture

### Backend Implementation

#### Database Schema Changes

1. **Post Model Updates**:
   - Added `PostType` enum with values: `Post`, `Comment`, `QuoteTweet`
   - Added `QuotedPostId` property to reference the original post
   - Added `QuoteTweetCount` property to track quote tweet metrics
   - Added navigation property `QuotedPost` for easy access

2. **Timeline Item Updates**:
   - Extended `TimelineItem` type to include `quote_tweet`
   - Quote tweets appear as regular posts in timelines with embedded quoted content

#### API Endpoints

1. **POST /api/posts/quote-tweet**
   - Creates a quote tweet with text content only
   - Request body: `CreateQuoteTweetDto`
   - Returns: `PostDto` with embedded quoted post

2. **POST /api/posts/quote-tweet-with-media**
   - Creates a quote tweet with text content and media attachments
   - Request body: `CreateQuoteTweetWithMediaDto`
   - Returns: `PostDto` with embedded quoted post and media

3. **GET /api/posts/{postId}/quote-tweets**
   - Retrieves all quote tweets for a specific post
   - Supports pagination with `page` and `pageSize` parameters
   - Returns: Array of `PostDto` objects

#### DTOs

```csharp
public class CreateQuoteTweetDto
{
    public string Content { get; set; }
    public int QuotedPostId { get; set; }
    public PostPrivacy Privacy { get; set; } = PostPrivacy.Public;
    public int? GroupId { get; set; }
}

public class CreateQuoteTweetWithMediaDto : CreateQuoteTweetDto
{
    public List<MediaFileDto> MediaFiles { get; set; } = new();
}
```

#### Service Layer

1. **PostService Updates**:
   - `CreateQuoteTweetAsync()` method for creating quote tweets
   - `CreateQuoteTweetWithMediaAsync()` method for quote tweets with media
   - `GetQuoteTweetsAsync()` method for retrieving quote tweets
   - Updated timeline queries to include quote tweets

2. **Validation**:
   - Ensures quoted post exists and is accessible
   - Validates user permissions for the quoted post
   - Prevents circular quote tweet references
   - Enforces content length limits

### Frontend Implementation (Web)

#### Components

1. **QuoteTweetModal**:
   - Modal dialog for creating quote tweets
   - Supports text input, media upload, and GIF selection
   - Displays the quoted post in a preview format
   - Privacy settings and submission controls

2. **PostCard Updates**:
   - Added quote tweet button with purple color scheme
   - Displays quoted post content in a bordered container
   - Shows quote tweet count in action buttons
   - Handles quote tweet modal state

3. **TimelineItemCard Updates**:
   - Handles `quote_tweet` timeline item type
   - Renders quote tweets as regular posts with embedded content

#### Features

- **Media Support**: Quote tweets can include images, videos, and GIFs
- **Privacy Controls**: Users can set privacy levels for quote tweets
- **Real-time Updates**: Quote tweet counts update immediately
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

### Mobile Implementation (React Native)

#### Components

1. **QuoteTweetModal**:
   - Native modal with keyboard-aware scrolling
   - Image picker integration for media uploads
   - GIF picker support
   - Native styling with theme support

2. **PostCard Updates**:
   - Added quote tweet button with native touch feedback
   - Embedded quoted post display with proper styling
   - Navigation integration for user interactions

#### Features

- **Native Media Picker**: Integration with device photo library
- **Gesture Support**: Native touch interactions and animations
- **Theme Integration**: Supports light/dark mode themes
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering for large timelines

## User Experience

### Quote Tweet Creation Flow

1. User clicks quote tweet button on any post
2. Quote tweet modal opens with the original post displayed
3. User adds their commentary and optional media
4. User selects privacy settings
5. User submits the quote tweet
6. Modal closes and timeline refreshes to show the new quote tweet

### Quote Tweet Display

- Quote tweets appear in timelines as regular posts
- The quoted post is displayed in a bordered container below the user's commentary
- Quoted posts show original author, content, and media (if any)
- Quote tweet counts are displayed alongside like, comment, and repost counts

### Interaction Patterns

- Clicking on quoted post author navigates to their profile
- Quoted post media can be viewed in full screen
- Quote tweets can themselves be quoted (nested quoting)
- Quote tweets appear in both the author's timeline and followers' feeds

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

1. **Database Optimization**:
   - Indexed `QuotedPostId` for efficient queries
   - Optimized timeline queries to include quoted posts in single query
   - Cached quote tweet counts for better performance

2. **Frontend Optimization**:
   - Lazy loading of quoted post media
   - Efficient re-rendering with React Query caching
   - Optimistic updates for immediate user feedback

### Security

1. **Access Control**:
   - Users can only quote posts they have permission to view
   - Private posts cannot be quoted by non-followers
   - Group posts can only be quoted within the same group

2. **Content Validation**:
   - Quote tweet content is sanitized and validated
   - Media uploads follow existing security protocols
   - Rate limiting applies to quote tweet creation

### Scalability

1. **Database Design**:
   - Efficient indexing for quote tweet queries
   - Proper foreign key relationships with cascading deletes
   - Optimized for high-volume quote tweet scenarios

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Quote tweet counts cached in Redis
   - Timeline queries optimized with proper pagination
   - Media URLs cached for faster loading

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Quote tweet creation with various scenarios
- Quote tweet retrieval and pagination
- Timeline integration with quote tweets
- Permission and validation testing

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end quote tweet creation flow
- Timeline display with mixed content types
- Media upload with quote tweets
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Performance Tests

- High-volume quote tweet creation
- Timeline loading with many quote tweets
- Database query performance under load
- Mobile app performance with quote tweets

## Deployment

### Database Migration

```sql
-- Add PostType column to Posts table
ALTER TABLE Posts ADD PostType int NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- Add QuotedPostId column
ALTER TABLE Posts ADD QuotedPostId int NULL;

-- Add QuoteTweetCount column
ALTER TABLE Posts ADD QuoteTweetCount int NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- Add foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE Posts ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Posts_QuotedPost 
FOREIGN KEY (QuotedPostId) REFERENCES Posts(Id);

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX IX_Posts_QuotedPostId ON Posts(QuotedPostId);
```

### Configuration

No additional configuration required. The feature uses existing:
- Media upload settings
- Privacy controls
- Rate limiting configurations
- Notification systems
