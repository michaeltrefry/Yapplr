# Post Filtering Test Suite Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite created for the hybrid post filtering system refactor.

## Overview

The test suite covers the new hybrid approach to post visibility that separates permanent post-level hiding from dynamic user-based filtering. This architectural improvement addresses performance and maintainability issues by eliminating the need for bulk post updates when user status changes.

## Test Files Created

### 1. PostFilteringTests.cs
**Purpose**: Core tests for the hybrid post filtering system
**Test Count**: 25 tests
**Coverage**:
- Permanent post-level hiding (IsHidden flag with PostHiddenReasonType)
- Real-time user status checks (suspension, trust scores)
- User-specific filtering (blocking, privacy settings)
- Video processing special cases
- QueryFilters extension method integration

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Hidden posts are properly filtered from results
- Video processing posts are visible to authors but hidden from others
- Posts from suspended/banned users are filtered in real-time
- Low trust score posts are filtered except for the author
- Blocked user posts are filtered
- Privacy settings are respected (public vs followers-only)

### 2. PostFilteringIntegrationTests.cs
**Purpose**: Complex integration scenarios testing multiple filtering conditions
**Test Count**: 8 tests
**Coverage**:
- Complex multi-user, multi-post scenarios
- Author viewing their own content (including low trust/hidden posts)
- Public timeline filtering with multiple conditions
- Video processing edge cases
- Followers-only post visibility with relationship checks
- Performance testing with larger datasets
- Edge cases (empty database, null users)

### 3. PostHiddenReasonTypeTests.cs
**Purpose**: Tests for the PostHiddenReasonType enum and its business logic
**Test Count**: 39 tests
**Coverage**:
- Enum value validation and consistency
- String conversion and parsing
- Business logic categorization (permanent vs temporary hiding)
- Integration with Post model
- Special handling for VideoProcessing reason type

**Key Validations**:
- Enum values match expected constants
- All hiding reasons except VideoProcessing are permanent
- VideoProcessing allows author visibility
- Proper integration with Post model properties

### 4. QueryUtilitiesTests.cs
**Purpose**: Tests for QueryUtilities extension methods
**Test Count**: 15 tests
**Coverage**:
- GetPostsWithIncludes() navigation property loading
- ApplyPublicVisibilityFilters() public timeline filtering
- GetBlockedUserIdsAsync() and GetFollowingUserIdsAsync() helper methods
- CanViewHiddenContentAsync() permission checking

**Key Scenarios**:
- Navigation properties are properly loaded
- Public timeline only shows appropriate content
- Blocked and following user ID retrieval works correctly
- Hidden content viewing permissions (admin, moderator, owner)

### 5. QueryBuilderTests.cs
**Purpose**: Tests for the QueryBuilder fluent interface
**Test Count**: 15 tests
**Coverage**:
- Basic QueryBuilder construction and usage
- Where clause chaining and filtering
- Include() for navigation properties
- OrderBy() and OrderByDescending() sorting
- Paginate() with parameter validation
- Execution methods (ToListAsync, FirstOrDefaultAsync, etc.)
- Complex method chaining scenarios

### 6. AdminServicePostModerationTests.cs
**Purpose**: Tests for AdminService moderation functionality
**Test Count**: 11 tests
**Coverage**:
- HidePostAsync() and UnhidePostAsync() operations
- Bulk hiding operations
- Post moderation queue filtering
- Statistics reporting for hidden posts
- Error handling for non-existent posts/users

## Key Features Tested

### Hybrid Filtering Architecture
- **Permanent Post-Level Hiding**: Tests verify that posts with IsHidden=true and specific PostHiddenReasonType values are properly filtered
- **Real-Time User Checks**: Tests confirm that user status and trust scores are checked dynamically without requiring post updates
- **Performance Optimization**: Integration tests validate that the new approach performs well with larger datasets

### Special Cases
- **Video Processing**: Comprehensive tests for the special case where video processing posts are hidden from public but visible to authors
- **Trust Score Filtering**: Tests verify that low trust users' posts are filtered in real-time except when viewed by the author
- **Privacy Levels**: Tests confirm proper handling of public vs followers-only content

### Database Optimization
- Tests validate that the new composite index (IX_Posts_HybridVisibility) is utilized effectively
- QueryBuilder tests ensure efficient query construction and execution

## Test Results

All test suites are passing:
- **PostFilteringTests**: 25/25 tests passing
- **PostFilteringIntegrationTests**: 8/8 tests passing  
- **PostHiddenReasonTypeTests**: 39/39 tests passing
- **QueryUtilitiesTests**: 15/15 tests passing
- **QueryBuilderTests**: 15/15 tests passing
- **AdminServicePostModerationTests**: 11/11 tests passing

**Total**: 113 tests covering the post filtering refactor

## Benefits Validated

1. **Performance**: Tests confirm no bulk post updates are needed when user status changes
2. **Consistency**: Centralized filtering logic is properly tested and reusable
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between permanent and dynamic hiding is validated
4. **Flexibility**: Special cases like video processing are properly handled
5. **Scalability**: Real-time user checks avoid expensive bulk operations

## Test Coverage Areas

- ✅ Permanent post-level hiding with all reason types
- ✅ Real-time user status filtering (active, suspended, banned, shadow banned)
- ✅ Trust score-based filtering with author exceptions
- ✅ User blocking and following relationship filtering
- ✅ Privacy setting enforcement (public, followers-only)
- ✅ Video processing special visibility rules
- ✅ Admin/moderator hidden content viewing permissions
- ✅ Query optimization and performance
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Integration between multiple filtering conditions

This comprehensive test suite ensures the hybrid post filtering system works correctly across all scenarios and maintains the expected behavior while providing significant performance improvements.
