# Notification Banner Enhancements

This document describes the enhanced notification banner features implemented for the Yapplr mobile app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Navigation on Tap ✅
When users tap on a notification banner, the app now navigates to the relevant screen based on the notification type:

- **Message notifications**: Navigate to the conversation screen
- **Mention/Comment/Like/Repost notifications**: Navigate to the post (currently logs action, full implementation pending)
- **Follow notifications**: Navigate to the user's profile
- **Other notifications**: No navigation (stays on current screen)

**Implementation**: 
- `NotificationNavigationService.ts` - Handles navigation logic
- Integrated with React Navigation using navigation refs
- Supports different notification types with appropriate routing

### 2. Banner Queue System ✅
Multiple notifications that arrive quickly are now queued and displayed sequentially instead of overlapping:

- **Queue Management**: Notifications are added to a queue if one is already showing
- **Sequential Display**: After a notification is dismissed, the next one in queue is shown automatically
- **Smooth Transitions**: 300ms delay between notifications for smooth UX
- **Queue Processing**: Both tap and auto-dismiss trigger queue processing

**Implementation**:
- Queue state management in `NotificationBannerManager.tsx`
- Automatic processing of next notification after dismissal
- Memory-based queue (resets on app restart)

### 3. Custom Swipe Actions ✅
Users can now perform actions by swiping the notification banner:

- **Swipe Right**: Mark notification as read (provides success haptic feedback)
- **Swipe Left**: Reply to message notifications (provides medium haptic feedback)
- **Gesture Recognition**: Uses react-native-gesture-handler for smooth swipe detection
- **Visual Feedback**: Banner translates during swipe with spring-back animation
- **Threshold Detection**: Configurable swipe distance and velocity thresholds

**Implementation**:
- `PanGestureHandler` integration in `NotificationBanner.tsx`
- Swipe action callbacks in `NotificationBannerManager.tsx`
- Haptic feedback for successful actions

### 4. Sound and Haptic Feedback ✅
Different notification types now provide appropriate audio and haptic feedback:

**Haptic Patterns**:
- **Messages**: Medium haptic + double vibration pattern
- **Mentions**: Heavy haptic + strong single vibration
- **Likes**: Light haptic + light vibration (no sound)
- **Comments**: Medium haptic + standard vibration
- **Follows**: Success haptic + triple vibration pattern
- **Reposts**: Light haptic + light vibration (no sound)

**Sound Support**:
- System notification sounds for important notifications
- Configurable per notification type
- Respects user's notification settings

**Implementation**:
- `NotificationFeedbackService.ts` - Centralized feedback management
- Uses expo-haptics for iOS haptic feedback
- Uses React Native Vibration API for Android
- Graceful fallbacks when APIs are unavailable

## Testing

### Manual Testing
Use the **Notification Test Screen** to test the enhanced features:

1. **Queue Test**: Sends multiple notifications rapidly to test queuing
2. **Swipe Test**: Sends a message notification to test swipe actions
3. **Navigation Test**: Tap notifications to test navigation
4. **Feedback Test**: All notifications provide haptic/sound feedback

### Test Scenarios
1. **Single Notification**: Tap to navigate, swipe to perform actions
2. **Multiple Notifications**: Verify queuing and sequential display
3. **Swipe Actions**: Test both left and right swipes on message notifications
4. **Feedback**: Verify different haptic patterns for different notification types
5. **Navigation**: Test navigation to conversations, profiles, and posts

## Configuration

### Feedback Settings
```typescript
// Enable/disable all feedback
NotificationFeedbackService.setEnabled(true);

// Enable/disable specific feedback types
NotificationFeedbackService.setSoundEnabled(true);
NotificationFeedbackService.setHapticEnabled(true);
```

### Navigation Setup
The navigation service is automatically configured when the app starts. No additional setup required.

### Swipe Thresholds
Swipe sensitivity can be adjusted in `NotificationBanner.tsx`:
```typescript
const swipeThreshold = 50; // Distance threshold
const velocityThreshold = 500; // Velocity threshold
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Custom Sounds**: Load different sound files for different notification types
2. **Visual Swipe Indicators**: Show icons during swipe to indicate available actions
3. **Persistent Queue**: Save notification queue to storage for app restart recovery
4. **Advanced Navigation**: Fetch full post data for better post navigation
5. **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize feedback patterns and swipe actions
6. **Analytics**: Track user interaction with banner features

### API Integration
1. **Mark as Read**: Integrate with backend API to actually mark notifications as read
2. **Reply Intent**: Pass reply context when navigating to conversations
3. **Notification Acknowledgment**: Send read receipts to backend

## Dependencies

- `react-native-gesture-handler`: For swipe gesture recognition
- `expo-haptics`: For iOS haptic feedback
- `expo-av`: For custom sound playback (future enhancement)
- `@react-navigation/native`: For navigation integration

## Compatibility

- **iOS**: Full feature support including haptic feedback
- **Android**: Full feature support with vibration patterns
- **Expo Go**: Limited haptic support, full gesture and navigation support
- **Development Build**: Full feature support recommended for testing
