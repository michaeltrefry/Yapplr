## üîß Development

### Configuration Management

The project includes powerful configuration management tools for easy testing and deployment:

```bash
# Quick notification provider switching
npm run config:platform-optimized  # SignalR web + Firebase mobile (recommended)
npm run config:signalr-only        # SignalR only (great for web testing)
npm run config:firebase-only       # Firebase only (mobile-focused)
npm run config:both                # Both providers (maximum coverage)
npm run config:none                # Polling only (baseline testing)

# Check current configuration
npm run config:status

# Manual configuration script
node configure-notifications.js [option]
```

The configuration system automatically updates both frontend and backend settings, making it easy to test different notification strategies without manual file editing.

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Create new migration
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName

# Migrations run automatically at application startup
# No manual database update needed - just restart the API
dotnet run
```

**Automatic Migration System**: Database migrations now run automatically when the API starts, eliminating deployment issues and ensuring consistency across environments.

### Environment Configuration

#### Backend (appsettings.json)
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=yapplr_db;Username=postgres;Password=postgres"
  },
  "JwtSettings": {
    "SecretKey": "your-secret-key",
    "Issuer": "Yapplr.Api",
    "Audience": "Yapplr.Frontend"
  }
}
```

#### Frontend (.env.local)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5161
```

## üîî Notification Configuration

Yapplr features a sophisticated platform-aware notification system that automatically selects the best notification provider for each platform.

### Platform-Optimized Strategy
- **Web/Desktop**: SignalR WebSocket notifications for instant real-time delivery
- **Mobile**: Firebase push notifications for battery-efficient delivery even when app is closed
- **Automatic Detection**: Platform detection automatically selects the optimal provider

### Quick Configuration
```bash
# Platform-optimized (recommended)
npm run config:platform-optimized

# Test individual providers
npm run config:signalr-only     # SignalR only
npm run config:firebase-only    # Firebase only
npm run config:both            # Both providers
npm run config:none            # Polling only

# Check current configuration
npm run config:status
```

### Environment Variables
```env
# Platform-Specific Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FIREBASE_WEB=false      # Firebase for web
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SIGNALR=true            # SignalR for web
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FIREBASE=true           # Firebase for mobile
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SIGNALR_MOBILE=false    # SignalR for mobile
```

### Backend Configuration
```json
{
  "NotificationProviders": {
    "Firebase": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "ProjectId": "your-firebase-project-id"
    },
    "SignalR": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "MaxConnectionsPerUser": 10
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing
