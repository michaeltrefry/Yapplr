## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9 SDK
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Redis 7+ (or Docker for Redis container)
- Docker (for content moderation service and Redis)

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to API directory
cd Yapplr.Api

# Install dependencies
dotnet restore

# Setup database (creates yapplr_db)
./setup-db.sh

# Start the API (migrations run automatically at startup)
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5161`

**Note**: Database migrations now run automatically when the API starts, ensuring your database is always up-to-date.

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd yapplr-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5161" > .env.local

# Start the frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Content Moderation Service Setup

```bash
# Navigate to sentiment analysis directory
cd sentiment-analysis

# Build and run the Docker container
docker build -t sentiment-analysis .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name sentiment-analysis-container sentiment-analysis

# Verify the service is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

The content moderation service will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

**Note**: The API automatically connects to the content moderation service. If the service is unavailable, content moderation will be disabled gracefully without affecting other functionality.

### 4. Redis Setup (Recommended for Performance)

Redis provides high-performance caching for count operations, dramatically improving response times.

#### Option A: Docker Redis (Recommended)
```bash
# Using Docker Compose (includes Redis)
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build -d

# Verify Redis is running
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml exec redis redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

#### Option B: Local Redis Installation
```bash
# macOS
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server

# Windows
# Download from https://redis.io/download
```

#### Configuration
Add to `Yapplr.Api/appsettings.Development.json`:
```json
{
  "Redis": {
    "ConnectionString": "localhost:6379"
  }
}
```

#### Verify Redis Caching
```bash
# Check if caching is working
curl http://localhost:5161/health

# Monitor Redis keys (should see count:* keys)
redis-cli keys "count:*"
```

**Note**: If Redis is unavailable, the application automatically falls back to memory caching without affecting functionality.

### 5. Mobile App Setup (Optional)

```bash
# Navigate to mobile app directory
cd YapplrMobile

# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Build shared package
cd ../yapplr-shared
npm install && npm run build

# Start mobile development server
cd ../YapplrMobile
npx expo start
```

## üîß Development

### Configuration Management

The project includes powerful configuration management tools for easy testing and deployment:

```bash
# Quick notification provider switching
npm run config:platform-optimized  # SignalR web + Firebase mobile (recommended)
npm run config:signalr-only        # SignalR only (great for web testing)
npm run config:firebase-only       # Firebase only (mobile-focused)
npm run config:both                # Both providers (maximum coverage)
npm run config:none                # Polling only (baseline testing)

# Check current configuration
npm run config:status

# Manual configuration script
node configure-notifications.js [option]
```

The configuration system automatically updates both frontend and backend settings, making it easy to test different notification strategies without manual file editing.

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Create new migration
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName

# Migrations run automatically at application startup
# No manual database update needed - just restart the API
dotnet run
```

**Automatic Migration System**: Database migrations now run automatically when the API starts, eliminating deployment issues and ensuring consistency across environments.

### Environment Configuration

#### Backend (appsettings.json)
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=yapplr_db;Username=postgres;Password=postgres"
  },
  "JwtSettings": {
    "SecretKey": "your-secret-key",
    "Issuer": "Yapplr.Api",
    "Audience": "Yapplr.Frontend"
  }
}
```

#### Frontend (.env.local)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5161
```

## üîî Notification Configuration

Yapplr features a sophisticated platform-aware notification system that automatically selects the best notification provider for each platform.

### Platform-Optimized Strategy
- **Web/Desktop**: SignalR WebSocket notifications for instant real-time delivery
- **Mobile**: Firebase push notifications for battery-efficient delivery even when app is closed
- **Automatic Detection**: Platform detection automatically selects the optimal provider

### Quick Configuration
```bash
# Platform-optimized (recommended)
npm run config:platform-optimized

# Test individual providers
npm run config:signalr-only     # SignalR only
npm run config:firebase-only    # Firebase only
npm run config:both            # Both providers
npm run config:none            # Polling only

# Check current configuration
npm run config:status
```

### Environment Variables
```env
# Platform-Specific Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FIREBASE_WEB=false      # Firebase for web
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SIGNALR=true            # SignalR for web
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FIREBASE=true           # Firebase for mobile
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SIGNALR_MOBILE=false    # SignalR for mobile
```

### Backend Configuration
```json
{
  "NotificationProviders": {
    "Firebase": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "ProjectId": "your-firebase-project-id"
    },
    "SignalR": {
      "Enabled": true,
