# Social Groups Frontend and Mobile Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of social groups functionality for both the frontend (Next.js) and mobile (React Native) applications.

## Frontend Implementation (yapplr-frontend)

### 1. API Integration
- **File**: `src/lib/api.ts`
- **Added**: Complete group API functions with proper TypeScript types
- **Features**: 
  - Get groups (paginated)
  - Search groups
  - Get group by ID/name
  - Create/update/delete groups
  - Join/leave groups
  - Get group members and posts
  - Upload group images

### 2. Types and Interfaces
- **File**: `src/types/index.ts`
- **Added**: `PaginatedResult<T>` interface for consistent API responses
- **Existing**: Group-related types were already defined

### 3. Components Created

#### Core Components
- **GroupCard**: Displays group information with join/leave functionality
- **GroupList**: Paginated list of groups with infinite scroll
- **GroupMembersList**: Displays group members with pagination
- **GroupHeader**: Group profile header with stats and actions
- **GroupTimeline**: Custom timeline for group posts

#### Modal Components
- **CreateGroupModal**: Form for creating new groups
- **EditGroupModal**: Form for editing groups (owner only)

### 4. Pages Created
- **Groups Listing** (`/groups`): Main groups page with search and tabs
- **Group Detail** (`/groups/[id]`): Individual group page with posts and members

### 5. Navigation Updates
- **Sidebar**: Added Groups navigation link with Users icon
- **Routing**: Groups pages are properly integrated into Next.js routing

### 6. Post Integration
- **CreatePost**: Updated to support posting to groups
- **PostCard**: Updated to display group context when post belongs to a group

### 7. Recent Fixes (July 2025)
- **Image Display Fix**: Resolved issue where group post images weren't displaying
  - **Root Cause**: GroupService was missing IHttpContextAccessor dependency
  - **Solution**: Added HttpContextAccessor injection and updated post mapping to include HttpContext
  - **Result**: Group posts now properly generate image URLs and display media content
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `Yapplr.Api/Services/GroupService.cs` - Added IHttpContextAccessor dependency
    - `Yapplr.Api.Tests/GroupServiceTests.cs` - Updated tests to include new dependency

## Mobile Implementation (YapplrMobile)

### 1. API Integration

- **GroupDetailScreen**: Individual group view with posts/members tabs
