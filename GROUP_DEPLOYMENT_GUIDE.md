# Social Groups Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Backend group services are implemented and running
- Database migrations for groups are applied
- API endpoints are accessible and tested

## Frontend Deployment (yapplr-frontend)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd yapplr-frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Build and Test
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Verify Implementation
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/groups`
- Check browser console for errors
- Test basic functionality

### 4. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your environment:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_backend_url
```

## Mobile Deployment (YapplrMobile)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd YapplrMobile
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. iOS Setup (if applicable)
```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### 3. Start Development
```bash
# For iOS
npm run ios
# or
yarn ios

# For Android
npm run android
# or
yarn android
```

### 4. Verify Implementation
- Open the app
- Navigate to Groups tab
- Check for crashes or errors
- Test basic functionality

## Production Deployment

### Frontend Production
```bash
cd yapplr-frontend
npm run build
npm start
```

### Mobile Production
Follow your existing mobile deployment process:
- Build release versions
- Test on physical devices
- Deploy through app stores

## Configuration Notes

### API Endpoints
The following endpoints should be available:
```
GET    /api/groups
GET    /api/groups/search
GET    /api/groups/{id}
POST   /api/groups
PUT    /api/groups/{id}
DELETE /api/groups/{id}
POST   /api/groups/{id}/join
POST   /api/groups/{id}/leave
GET    /api/groups/{id}/members
GET    /api/groups/{id}/posts
GET    /api/groups/me
GET    /api/groups/user/{userId}
POST   /api/groups/upload-image
```

### Database Requirements
Ensure these tables exist:
- Groups
- GroupMembers
- Posts (with GroupId column)
- Users (existing)

### File Upload
- Group image upload endpoint should be configured
- File storage should be accessible from frontend
- Proper CORS settings for file uploads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. TypeScript Errors
```bash
# Check for type issues
npx tsc --noEmit
```

#### 2. API Connection Issues
- Verify API URL is correct
- Check CORS settings
- Ensure authentication headers are sent

#### 3. Mobile Build Issues
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cd YapplrMobile
npx react-native clean
npm run android # or ios
```

#### 4. Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Frontend
cd yapplr-frontend
npm install react-intersection-observer

# Mobile (if needed)
cd YapplrMobile
npm install @react-navigation/native
```

### Debug Steps

#### Frontend Debugging
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check Network tab for API calls
3. Look for console errors
4. Verify component rendering

#### Mobile Debugging
1. Use React Native Debugger
2. Check Metro bundler logs
3. Use device logs (Xcode/Android Studio)
4. Test on physical devices

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend
- Images are lazy-loaded
- Infinite scroll is implemented
- API calls are cached where appropriate

### Mobile
- FlatList is used for efficient rendering
- Images are cached
- Pull-to-refresh is implemented

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- All API calls include authentication headers
- Protected routes require login
- Group ownership is verified server-side

### Data Validation
- Form validation on client-side
- Server-side validation is required
- File upload restrictions should be enforced

## Monitoring

### Frontend Monitoring
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Monitor API response times
- Track user interactions

### Mobile Monitoring
- Monitor crash reports
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor API usage

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur
1. **Frontend**: Revert to previous deployment
2. **Mobile**: Use feature flags to disable groups
3. **Database**: Have migration rollback scripts ready

### Quick Disable
If needed, you can quickly disable groups by:
1. Removing the Groups link from navigation
2. Adding feature flag checks
3. Returning empty results from API

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Immediate (0-1 hour)
- [ ] Verify groups page loads
- [ ] Test group creation
- [ ] Test join/leave functionality
- [ ] Check mobile app launches

### Short-term (1-24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check API performance
- [ ] Verify user adoption
- [ ] Test on various devices

### Medium-term (1-7 days)
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Check for edge cases
- [ ] Plan improvements

## Support Information

### Key Files to Monitor
```
Frontend:
- src/lib/api.ts (API calls)
- src/components/Group*.tsx (Components)
- src/app/groups/* (Pages)

Mobile:
- src/api/client.ts (API calls)
- src/screens/main/Group*.tsx (Screens)
- src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx (Navigation)
```

### Logs to Check
- API server logs for group endpoints
- Frontend console errors
- Mobile crash reports
- Database query performance

### Metrics to Track
- Group creation rate
- Join/leave actions
- Page load times
- API response times
- Error rates

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can browse groups
- [ ] Users can create groups
- [ ] Users can join/leave groups
- [ ] Users can post in groups
- [ ] No critical errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Mobile and web work consistently

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. Monitor usage and performance
2. Gather user feedback
3. Plan feature enhancements
4. Consider additional group features:
   - Group privacy settings
   - Group moderation tools
   - Group categories/tags
   - Group events
   - Group analytics
